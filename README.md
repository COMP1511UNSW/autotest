Autotest runs a series of tests on 1 or more programs comparing their behaviour to specified expected behaviour.

Autotest focuses on producing output comprehensible to a novice programmer
perhaps in their first coding course.

The autotest syntax is designed to allow tests to be specified quickly and concisely.

Tests are typically specified in a single file named by default *tests.txt*.

Autotest syntax is designed to allow succinct convenient specification of tests, e.g.:

```
files=is_prime.c

1 stdin="39" expected_stdout="29 is not prime\n"
2 stdin="42" expected_stdout="42 is not prime\n"
3 stdin="47" expected_stdout="47 is prime\n"
```

## Installing requirements

This project uses `pipenv` to manage requirements. You will need to install pipenv with `python3 -m pip install pipenv` and then fetch dependencies using `pipenv install`. 

To run the script within the environment, it should be invoked using `pipenv run python autotest.py`.

## Running Autotest

Autotest allows flexible specification of command line arguments, so it can be comfortable
used by novices who little experience with command-line programs.

Autotest will typically be run via a wrapper shell script which
specifies arguments and parameters values appropriate for a class, for example,
specifiying the base directory to search for autotests, e.g:


```bash
#!/bin/sh

parameters="
	default_compilers = {'c' : [['clang', '-Werror', '-std=gnu11', '-g', '-lm']]}
	upload_url = https://example.com/autotest.cgi
"

exec /usr/local/autotest/autotest.py --exercise_directory /home/class/activities --parameters "$parameters" "$@"
```

Students can then run the wrapper script simply specifying  the particular class exercise they wish to
autotest, perhaps:

```bash
$ autotest.sh is_prime
```

Some useful command-line options are useful when developing test specifications, include:

**-a AUTOTEST_DIRECTORY, --autotest_directory AUTOTEST_DIRECTORY** specify directly the location
of the autotest specification.

**-D DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY** copty files in the specified to the test directory.

**-g, --generate_expected_output** generate expected output for the tests
by executing the supplied files.

for example, this will update the test specification in the directory  `my_autotest` using a
model solution in `my_solution`

```bash
$ autotest.py --generate_expected_output=update --directory my_solution  --autotest_directory my_autotest
```


## Test Execution Environment

A temporary directory is created for autotests and the program to be
tested is copied there and compiled there if needed.

By default any other files in the test specification directory are also
copied to the temporary directory (see the `supplied_files_directory` parameter)

By default tests are executed in an environment stripped of most environment variables
but this can be specified with test parameters.

By default tests are executed with resource limits which can be specified with test parameters.


## Tests

A test consists of a label and set of parameter value.

Every test must have a unique label consisting of alphanumeric characters and underscore ([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)

The file is read sequentially and when a test label is reached
a test is created with the current values of parameters.

Assignments to parameter values apply to any following test or until
a different value is assigned to the parameter.

Except assignments to parameter values on the same line as a test label
are used only for that test. For example in the follow example
the CPU limit for *test1* is 5 seconds and the CPU limit for *test2* is 10 seconds.

```
max_cpu_seconds=10

test1  max_cpu_seconds=5  command=./prime.py 41  expected_stdout="True\n"

test2  command=./prime.py 42  expected_stdout="False\n"
```

If a command is a single string it is passed to a shell for evaluation

A test label may be used multiple times to supply the value of different parameters for the test.

```
max_cpu_seconds=10
program=prime.py

test1  max_cpu_seconds=5  arguments=41 expected_stdout="True\n"

test2  arguments=42  expected_stdout="False\n"
```


## Parameter Assignments

Tests are specified by assigning values to parameters, for example:

```
max_cpu_seconds=10
```

Parameter names  start with an alphabetic letter and can contain
alphanumeric characters and underscore ([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)

The values assigned to parameters can use Python syntax including single-quotes,
double-quotes, triple-quotes and raw-quotes and f-strings.
Values can also be lists or dicts specified in Python syntax.

Triple-quoted strings, lists and dicts can be multi-line.

Parameters specified in previous lines are available as parameters in f-strings.
Parameters specified on the current line are not available in the evaluation of f-strings.

Assignment to a parameter name which is not a builtin parameter listed in the section below,
will produce an error unless the parameter name begins with a single '_'.
Parameter names begining with '_' can be given values to be used in later f-strings.


For convenience, values can also be written as shell-like unquoted strings
if they contain only non-whitespace ASCII and none of these characters **\\ = [ ] { } " ' **.
So for example, these are equivalent parameter assignments.

```
command=./a.out
command="./a.out"
```

Multiple unquoted strings are aggregated into a list so these are equivalent commands:

```
command=./a.out --print example.txt
command=['./a.out', '--print', 'example.txt']
```

Parameter values are coerced to an appropriate type if possible.
If a boolean type is expected, values are converted to be True or False following
Python rules, so for example . **`0  '' [] {}`** will all become  **`False`**,
except strings with a first characters of '0', 'f' or 'F' are considered  **`False`**

## Examples

```Python
files=prime.c

# specifying command-lines arguments
test1  arguments=41  expected_stdout="41 is prime.\n"

# specifying stdin
test2  stdin="42"  expected_stdout="42 is not prime.\n"

# using files to specify stdin and expected_stdout
test3  stdin=['43.txt']  expected_stdout=['43_expected_output.txt']

# running a  Shell command
test4 command="echo 44 | prime"   expected_stdout="44 is not prime.\n"

# using two line to specifiy test plus triple-quote for a multi-line string
test5  arguments=45
test5  expected_stdout="""45 is not prime.
"""

# specify more flexibility in test acceptance
# by ignoring white space, some punctuation characters (",.!") and extra new lines
test6  ignore_whitespace=True  ignore_blank_lines=True  ignore_characters=",.!"
test6  arguments=46  expected_stdout="46 is not prime.\n"


# make test succeed if it has just right digits in output
test7  arguments=47 compare_only_characters="0123456789" expected_stdout="47 is not prime.\n"
```

### Parameters specifying inputs for test

**`supplied_files_directory`**


If set to a non-empty string, any files in this directory are copied to the directory before testing.  
This directory is also prepended to any relative file pathnames in test specifications.  
Its default value is the directory containing the test specification file (`tests.txt`).  
Only one directory is copied for all tests.  This parameter must be set as a global parameter.
It is usually specified in a wrapper shell script via -P.

**`stdin`**


Bytes supplied on stdin for test.  
Deprocated: stdin is not specified and the file *test_label*`.stdin` exists, its contents are used.

**`environment_kept`** = 'ARCH|C_CHECK_.*|DCC_.*|DRYRUN_.*|LANG|LANGUAGE|LC_.*|LOGNAME|USER'


Environment variables are by default deleted to avoid them affecting testing.  
Environment variables whose entire name matches this regex are not deleted.  
All other environment variables are deleted.

**`environment_base`**


Dict specifying values for environment variables.  
Default:

```
{
'LC_COLLATE' : 'POSIX',
'LC_NUMERIC' : 'POSIX',
'PERL5LIB' : '.',
'HOME' : '.',
'PATH' : '/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:.:$PATH',
}, 
```
where `$PATH` is the original value of `PATH`.

The environment  variables in **`environment_base`** are set and then,
environment  variables specified in **`environment_set`** are set.<bt>
This parameter should not normally be used.<bt>
The parameter **`environment_set`** should normally be used instead of this parameter.<bt>
It is only necessary to specify **`environment_base`** if these variables need to be unset rather than given different values for a test.<bt>

**`environment_set`** = {}


Dict specifying environment variables to be set for this test.  
For example: `environment_set={'answer' : 42 }`  
This is the parameter that should normally be used to manipulate environment variables. 

**`environment`**


Dict specifying all environment variables for this test.  
This parameter should not normally be specified,
**`environment_set`** will serve most purposes.  
By default **`environment`** is formed by taking original environment variables provided to autotest,  
removing all but those matching the regex in **`environment_variables_kept`**,  
setting any variables specified in **`environment_base`** and then  
setting any variables specified in **`environment_set`**.


### Parameters specifying expected output for test

**`expected_stdout`**


Bytes expected on stdout for this test.  
If value is a list it is treated as list of pathname of file(s) containing expected bytes.  
Deprocated: if **`expected_stdout`** is not specified and the file *test_label*`.expected_stdout` exists,
its contents are used.  
Not yet implemented: handling of non-unicode output.  

**`expected_stderr`**


Bytes expected on stderr for this test.  
If value is a list it is treated as list of pathname of file(s) containing expected bytes.  
Deprocated: if **`expected_stderr`** is not specified and the file *test_label*`.stderr` exists,
its contents are used.  
Not yet implemented: handling of non-unicode output.

**`expected_files`** = {}


Dict specified bytes expected to be written to  files.  
if value is an string, it is specifies bytes expected to be written to that filename.  
If a value is a list it is treated as list of pathname of file(s) containing expected bytes.  
For example: this indicates `a file named `answer.txt` should be created containing `42`.
`expected_files={"answer.txt":"42
"}`  

Not yet implemented: handling of non-unicode output.

The script *`bundle_autotests.sh`* generates a single executable for autotest.

It can also embed specified autotests in the executable allowing
distribution of a single file containing a set of autotests and the code to run them.


```
$ bundle_autotests.sh my_autotest exercise1/autotest exercise2/autotest exercise3/autotest
$ ./my_autotest exercise2
Test 0 (./prime 42) - passed
1 tests passed 0 tests failed
```
